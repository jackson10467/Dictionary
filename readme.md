#Hangman#
The API I plan on using is the WordsAPI, to create a hangman game. The twist here being that inplace of a "man" getting hanged
, elements on the page would start disappearing. 
Some goals would be a splash page that leads to the game, along with a page for the rules of hangman. 
The main functionality on this page would be the hangman game, featuring visual feedback on the user's guesses ie:
Correct guesses, already guessed letters, failed guesses. 

MVP Goals:
- Working HTML,CSS, JS : I expect getting the game to work will take up more than 2 days, CSS would take up the rest of the time
- Pulling data from Words API using Axios: Pulling random words from the words API is essential in getting Hangman working.
- Responsive design: This is the most difficult part for me, as I'm not currently sure how I would translate elements disappearing
on mobile devices, or if it would look good enough. Preferably, I would create a traditional hangman game first to make sure it's working.

Post MVP: 
- Get the disappearing elements to work, either on mobile, desktop, or both. (Might have to resort to traditional hangman if not enough time)
- Adding categories of words for the user to choose from
- Fancy CSS Animations
