# Dictionary
The API I plan on using is the WordsAPI, to create a working dictionary.
The main functionality on this page would be the dictionary, featuring visual feedback on the user's input. I would also like a random word to be displayed everytime the page loads. This project is pretty self explanatory

# MVP Goals:

- Working HTML,CSS, JS : I expect getting the dictionary functionality working relatively soon
- Pulling data from Words API using Axios: Pulling random words from the words API is essential in getting this working
- Responsive design: This is the most difficult part for me, as I'm not currently sure how I would get this styled in time. Preferably, I would create a plain page first to make sure it works, then move on to styling.

# Post MVP:
- Add Thesaurus (1/2)
- Add hangman game (Planned)
- Adding categories of words for the user to choose from for hangman (Planned)
- Add another API that does urban dictionary definitions; Dictionary After Dark (Planned)
- CSS Animations âœ…(1/2 Complete)
