# Dictionary
The API I plan on using is the WordsAPI, to create a working dictionary.
The main functionality on this page would be the dictionary, showing definitions based on user input. I would also like a random word to be displayed everytime the page loads. This project is pretty self explanatory. 

# MVP Goals:

- Working HTML,CSS, JS : I expect getting the dictionary functionality working relatively soon
- Pulling data from Words API using Axios: Pulling random words from the words API is crucial in getting functionality like search working.
- Responsive design: Working responsive design on at least recent mobile devices, including tablets.

# Post MVP:
- Add hangman game (Planned)
- Adding categories of words for the user to choose from for hangman (Planned)
- Add another API that does urban dictionary definitions; Dictionary After Dark (Planned)
- CSS Animations ✅(1/2 Complete)
- Add Thesaurus ✅(1/2) (Synonyms Complete)
