The API I plan on using is the WordsAPI, to create a working dictionary.

Some goals would be a splash page that leads to the dictionary. 
The main functionality on this page would be the dictionary, featuring visual feedback on the user's input. I would also like a random word to be displayed everytime the page loads. This project is pretty self explanatory

MVP Goals:
- Working HTML,CSS, JS : I expect getting the dictionary functionality working relatively soon
- Pulling data from Words API using Axios: Pulling random words from the words API is essential in getting this working
- Responsive design: This is the most difficult part for me, as I'm not currently sure how I would get this styled in time. Preferably, I would create a traditional page first to make sure it works

Post MVP: 
- Get hangman to remove elements of the page
- Add hangman to the page 
- Adding categories of words for the user to choose from for hangman
- Fancy CSS Animations
- SECOND API that does urban dictionary definitions; Dictionary After Dark
